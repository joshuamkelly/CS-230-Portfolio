# CS 230 Final Reflection - Draw It or Lose It

## Project Summary
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It into a cross-platform application that could handle multiple users, teams, and sessions securely and efficiently. The goal was to design software that could scale and run smoothly across different operating systems while keeping data centralized and consistent.

## What I Did Well
My strongest work was in the Software Design Document, especially in the Recommendations section. It clearly connects business needs with technical solutions such as platform choice, system architecture, memory management, storage strategy, and security.

## What Helped the Most
The domain model and UML diagram were some of the most helpful parts of the design process. They made it easier to understand how each class should interact and helped me organize the relationships between objects before I started writing any code. Having that visual plan kept my development focused and consistent.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part, I would expand the Evaluation section to include more measurable comparisons between platforms, such as cost, reliability, or performance benchmarks.

## Interpreting User Needs
When considering user needs, I focused on scalability and consistent performance across all devices. This helped shape every design choice, from architecture to security.

## Future Application
This project showed me how important clear design and planning are in software development. Building the architecture first made coding smoother and easier to maintain. It is a process I will continue to use in future projects because it saves time and prevents rework later on.
